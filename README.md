# Sorting Visualizer
This is a repository for a sorting visualizer. It is a simple program that visualizes the sorting algorithms. It is written in Python using the Pygame library.
It currently supports the following sorting algorithms:
* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort
* Radix Sort

## How to use
To use the program, you need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You also need to install the Pygame library. To install the Pygame library, run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
To run the program, run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
python SORTINGTYPE.py
```
where SORTINGTYPE is the sorting algorithm you want to visualize. For example, to visualize the bubble sort, run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
python bubblesort.py
```
